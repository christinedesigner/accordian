    	<p>From the dashboard, select "Manage Books". This will take you to a page that lists all the books that you have submitted into KitePress (see image above for example). This overview page shows the title, primary user, devices the ebook is being developed for, and most recent asset upload notes.</p>
    	<p>To manage the details of a particular title, simply click on the book's title.</p>
    <img src='img/headers.jpg' alt='simulator' width='750' height='55' />
    	<p>Now you are in the detailed section for that title. You'll notice a row of tabs with headers, like "Summary", "Information", "Authors", etc. All the specific details of your book can be found through those tabs.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Information"</strong> gives you fields to enter detailed metadata for the book, as well as a field for entering the link to a book trailer, if you have one.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Authors"</strong> allows you to add/remove key contributors to he book, like Author, Illustrator, and Narrator.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Audience"</strong> is where you'd enter the appropriate age range target for the book.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Pricing"</strong> includes a drop-down for selecting the ebook's retail price.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Subjects"</strong> includes the Bisac Categories and Subcategories where your book should be categorized within stores.</p>
    	<p><strong>"Editions"</strong> allows you to select the devices your ebook will be formatted for and sold.</p>

        What is a color profile? (RGB, CMYK)

      <div class="accordion-inner">
    <img src='img/color.jpg' alt='color profile' width='600' height='339' />
    	<p>As you are creating your book and first uploading your book PDF, KitePress checks to make sure your PDF has the correct "color profile". If it finds your PDF to be in CMYK, it will issue an error warning. This is because books destined for screen viewing should have an <strong>RGB</strong> color profile. Books that are designed for print use the CMYK color profile. Without an RGB color profile, book illustrations and graphics will appear less vivid and "washed out" on tablets and eReaders.</p>
